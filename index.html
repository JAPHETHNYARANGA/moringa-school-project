                    <p>I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I enjoy my time at school: it
                        is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help. The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I
                        think this is a strong point of mine.</p>
                    <p>My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting guy with a good sense of humor. As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. I believe that friendship is one of the most important
                        values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate friendship and people who surround me.</p>

                    <h5>My Education</h5>
                    <img src="image/MY EDUCATION.jpg" alt="EDUCATION" />
                    <p>I am currently taking an undergraduate degree in Industrial Chemistry with Management at Kenyatta University.</p>
                    <p>I decided to join Moringa School since i really wanted to get to know programming, and i also wanted to learn a new skill that can't just be learnt on the job. A skill that required someone to have some sort of special training, then
                        i thought to myself; why not join Moringa School? This is ofcourse after being told about it. And that how i began my software developement journey at Moringa School. </p>
